# NES_Nintendo_Remote_Scratch_2_Extension
Written back when scratch 2 was a thing. Flash died so now Scratch 2 Offline must be used to use this extension.

Adds support to use nintendo remotes to scratch. On windows there is a bundled python/pygame executable: pyg.exe otherwise install python and pygame to use.
